üìä Big Data Analysis - Internship Task 4 | CODTECH

This repository contains my submission for Task-4 of the CODTECH Internship Program, focused on sentiment-analysis.

üîç Task Overview:
In this task, I developed a sentiment analysis model to automatically classify text into different sentiment categories (such as positive, negative, and neutral). The goal was to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, or product reviews and determine the overall sentiment conveyed in the text.
